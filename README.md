# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** is what people use to create repositories to track their changes.

**GitHub** is a server that brings people together in the repositories that was created.

---
## Initial Setup
1. Create an account in [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Go to [IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) and to create an account you will need to connect it to your github account. 
3. To finish setting up go to this [link](https://github.com/hstatsep/ide50).

* While going through the setup in the directions in the link, you may wonder what is an SSH key and why is it important.
   * An SSH key is for public or private access to repositories in Github. SSH allows the user to just log on automatically without signing in to their account again. 
   * By adding this key it allows you to have access to other repositories easily and faster. If not you will have to keep on log in over again everytime.

## Repository Setup
To set up you will need to create a repository.

You need to type...
        
        1. git init  
  
**git init**: is to initialize git in your directory for version control

        2. git add

**git add**: is to add the current/entire directory: all files that have changes

        3. git commit
